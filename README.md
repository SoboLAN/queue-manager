# Queue Manager

## OBSOLETE - no longer maintained

An "ancient" project written in Java and Swing that simulates creation and serving of customers in queues

Depends on the [JFreeChart library](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) for displaying graphs of the queues.

Compiled binary is available in the `bin` directory.
